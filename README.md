## Summary
This a personal project for practicing with Scala programming language via [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges.

The exercises included are from:
* Domain "Functional Programming"
* Contest "Project Euler" _(just started!)_

*Please do not copy the solutions here to pass the exercises: instead of that I recommend you to find your own implementation and only then compare with the implementation I made (and please post a comment / give some feedback!).*
